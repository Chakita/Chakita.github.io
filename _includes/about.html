 <div class="user-details">
  <p> I am an aspiring Data Scientist who loves all things NLG and Data Science!
      I was a SDE intern at Amazon India, (Jan-June 2023) during which I learnt about A/B testing and got to see it in action! 
      This combined with the projects I worked on during my undergrad led me to pursue a Masters in Data Science.
      I was also an intern at Nasdaq (Jun 2022-Aug 2022) where I worked on back end development using Python.
